# **Boid Simulation Example**

Boid flocking simulation using Unreal Engine 5 and Instanced Static Mesh Component

## ABSTRACT

The original flocking behavior algorithm was created by Craig W. Reynolds in 1986, which sparked the research of artificial life. Although numerous implementations followed, the majority of them were in two dimensions, with only a handful of 3D projects available to the public.
The objective of this project was to design a high-performing and aesthetically pleasing implementation of flocking behavior utilizing C++ and Unreal Engine. My main focus was on creating a flexible and customizable system capable of accommodating a wide range of behaviors.
During the presentation, I will guide you through the development process, emphasizing the architectural decisions and optimization approaches. The project has been made open-source, and I enthusiastically invite collaboration from other experts in the field.
